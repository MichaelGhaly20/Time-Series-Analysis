# Time-Series-Analysis

### Forecasting with SES, DES, TES

Time series data are data that are kept in chronological order in a discrete manner at equal time intervals. For example, a one-year credit card statement can be considered as time series data for us. Because the extract is a data type that is kept at equal intervals and in chronological order. The fact that the data are ordered according to time brings about the correlation between the neighboring variables.

#### Modelling the Time Series

There are several ways to model a time seris to make predictions. It will be mentioned to the topics as below:

- Moving Average

- Weighted Average

**1. Exponential Smoothing Methods**

-Single Exponential Smoothing (Contains stationarity)

-Double Exponential Smoothing (Contains Level + Trend)

-Triple Exponential Smoothing Holt-Witers (Contains Level + Tred + Seasonality)
